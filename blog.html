                  Something I really struggle with (or 2 things) is taking my camera out
                  on general outings - whether it be by myself or with others. The second
                  thing is bridging the gap between professional and personal on platforms
                  such as this.<br>
                  I’m always unsure of what level of professionalism people expect from me
                  and what EVEN defines professionalism?! I could go on but that’s
                  probably another tangent for another day!<br>
                  Long story short - I’m working on improving both of these things by
                  keeping my camera with me more often during my down time and letting
                  you all have an insight into the awkward odd ball I am the majority of
                  the time!
                </p>

              <article class="content">

                <p>
                  With these things in mind, I wanted to write a blog entirely on the
                  breathtakingly beautiful experience of my recent honeymoon in Tulum,
                  Mexico. For a multitude of reasons I’ve never really traveled much
                  but now I find myself in a position to do so and I am so grateful
                  for the few but amazing places I have seen! Mexico has been one of my
                  top three destinations to go to for awhile now and what could be better
                  than visiting a tropical and cultural paradise? Well seeing it all with
                  my fantastic husband of course! For anyone that hasn’t been before I
                  highly recommend it and it is totally worth the crazy jet lag coming home!
                </p>

                <img class="img1" src="imgs/blog-min/blog8-2-min.png" alt="#">

                <p>My Tulum top tips!</p>

                <p>
                  <strong>1. Cenotes! Cenotes! CENOTES!</strong> - oh Lordy! These were an experience on
                  another level! I am not a strong swimmer and to anyone else that is
                  not, please don’t let it put you off. The majority of them have
                  equipment you can hire or just borrow for snorkelling and the beauty
                  of them is just awe inspiring!
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>2. Vegan paradise!</strong> - Mexico turned out to be a vegan paradise! Well
                  Tulum at least (not sure about everywhere else). Killian and myself
                  love eating yummy food together and with Kill being vegan we often
                  find ourselves in interesting places and Tulum was chock a block!
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>3. Bug spray</strong> - Pffffft I feel like I got more bites when I put spray on
                  but oh well. You deffo need at LEAST two bottles a week. You are going
                  to the jungle.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>4. Tulum town</strong> - Tulum is made up of the beach strip and the town, both are pretty touristy but the beach strip is the hipster international capital! We only went into the town once at the end of our time in Tulum
                  and how
                  I
                  wish
                  we’d gone earlier! Sooo much more to see, so much more to eat, and a million times cheaper. Top money saving tip!

                  HELLO LADIES! ...And gents obviously! Today is international women’s
                  day and I wanted to do a blog post to celebrate all the wonderful and
                  talented fems I’ve had the pleasure of working with lately.<br>
                  I’m always on the look out to collaborate with local businesses and
                  vendors and most recently I’ve worked with some corkers!
                  At the end of January, I teamed up with several lovely ladies to
                  create a styled wedding shoot. The shoot was inspired by combining
                  a variation of aesthetics, industrial with femininity and traditional
                  with alternative.
                </p>
              </div>
              <article class="content">

                <p>
                  All the wonderful women involved are local independent business owners,
                  some established, some just starting up but all extremely hard working,
                  kind and creative people that go the extra mile whilst doing
                  what they love.

                  I thought with the new year I should introduce myself! So here is
                  the who, what, why, where, when and how!

                  My name is Carmel Teresa McCabe and I want to photograph your
                  wedding/engagement/family portraits! I’m a passionate and bubbly
                  creative living in a sleepy village in South Wales currently
                  working as a commercial photographer. I moved to wales close
                  to 10 years ago now to study photography, fell in love with
                  the country (and a man), got a dog and the rest they say is history!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Ever since a young age photograph has been one of my biggest interests
                  and I’m so fortunate to be able to do it as a career! I started my
                  photography journey with a great kick start really, working with as a
                  secondary photograph to a wedding and portrait photographer back
                  in the midlands at the age of 16. Since then I have developed my own
                  style and skills, offering fun and fresh alternative photography for
                  those looking for something abit different!<br>
                  Photography above all things is my passion and I live to capture the
                  good and the happiness in this world! (CHEESY!)

                <p>
                  So what sets me apart you may ask, there sure are a bajillion wedding
                  photographers out there and the majority of them are flippin great!
                  (Such as my good friend LJ, who captured my wedding).<br>
                  I can’t speak for other photographers but for me, I’ve been on both
                  ends of the camera, and being a recent bride has blown my mind to what
                  you need from your photographer on your big day as well as allllll your
                  vendors. All of the anxiety and excitement, all of the crazy planning
                  and not really knowing when to book the cake or the flowers.<br>
                  BEEN THERE! That’s why I can say I’m here to help! Not only can I offer
                  you a bespoke photography service to suit your needs and budget but I’m
                  here to support you and help you anyway I know how with your big day!
                  I pride myself on offering a calm and relaxed atmosphere, minimal
                  stuffy posing (one for the grandparents), reliable and honest advice
                  and just a bit of a laugh as well! Because let’s face it, weddings
                  are stressful and really we just all want to have a good ol’knees up!
                </p>

                  I’m happy to say that even though we’re out of wedding season it’s
                  still business as usual! As we get closer to Christmas I’m seeing an
                  increase of family sessions which is always a refreshing a fun change
                  of scenery. It also gives me the opportunity to catch up with past
                  clients on the next chapter of their lives.

                <p>
                  Family and kids sessions can be a perfect gift for Christmas,
                  whether it be the shoot itself as an experience or prints for loved
                  ones. I want to share with you two different types of sessions
                  I experienced this November, plus something totally different!
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, I spent a drizzly Saturday morning with, quite frankly,
                  a dazzling family. The Rogers/Fishburn clan are a beautiful bunch
                  of brothers and sisters who got me involved to photograph them for
                  their mum and grand parents for Christmas. As I already mentioned,
                  the weather was pretty diabolical but we all wrapped up and soon
                  enough we hardly noticed!
                </p>

                <img class="img1" src="imgs/blog-min/blog5-3-min.png" alt="posing with umbrella's">

                <p>
                  Sometimes a prop like an umbrella can be a great little addition to a
                  playful shoot, especially with youngsters! We shot in the scenic belle
                  vue park in Newport, a place where they all had spent a lot of time
                  growing up, and a great spot for a rainy shoot with that band stand
                  being a life saver when the rain got a little too heavy to handle.
                  A great day! And probably one of my all time favourite shoots,
                  I love working with larger groups! So many more options and ideas!
                </p>

                <div class="blogflex">
                  <img class="img2" src="imgs/blog-min/blog5-4-min.png" alt="happy family!">

                </div>

                <p>
                  The second shoot I’d like to share with you today is something a little
                  outside of the norm for me but a success and something I hope to
                  experiment more with in the future. With the welsh weather being
                  a fickle mistress, location photography can be tricky and choc
                  full of postponements. One crazy Thursday was no exception, with it
                  being a little too wet and windy for my camera to handle. I was
                  meeting up with Vicky and her little girl Thea for some super
                  Christmassy shots for Theas grandparents.

                <p>
                  With the ideas we had now out the window, some fast thinking,
                  a bit of DIY and handy collection of tat allowed me to set up a
                  small studio area fit for a toddler inside from the cold. I, myself
                  am not one for studio shoots, having worked in a studio setting
                  before, I find them a little too restrictive. This however was
                  the perfect occasion for the little fiery lass who spent the majority
                  of the time chasing my dog and throwing tinsel on me than she did
                  say in front of the tree! It was a great experiment though and another
                  feather to my boa! Giving me the option of offering indoor sessions
                  for babies and toddlers.

                <p>
                  I’m so grateful for experiences like these, meeting new people,
                  working with fantastic individuals and challenging myself with
                  new creative responses! If any of the work shown throughout this
                  blog post has inspired you to join me for a great day out of family
                  fun then please get in touch via email. I’d be so excited to hear
                  from you!

                  As you may or may not know, my day job involves photographing peoples
                  houses. And although this was not the original direction I imagined for
                  myself after graduation, I am proud that I can count myself in the
                  select few that are putting their degree to use in their everyday
                  work. My job is outside of the norm, something interesting and has
                  helped shape a lot of skills I use today for my weddings and portraits.
                  I think it’s really important to appreciate the things in life that
                  we can easily take for granted. My work has increased my confidence
                  in meeting new people, my confidence in my work and my ability
                  as a photographer and not to mention my driving confidence.

                  With change and experience in mind, I wanted to share with you
                  something new for me. I live in the city of Newport, not the most
                  glamorous city in South Wales but filled with the hidden jewels of
                  great independent and creative businesses. Every year these people
                  team up to celebrate and showcase the wonderful creativity of
                  Newport and those who dwell within! I was fortunate enough to catch a
                  unique performance and exhibition in local Newport barber shop,
                  <a href="https://www.houndsthebarbershop.co.uk" target="_blank">Hounds</a> I have work planned with Paul,
                  the owner of Hounds in the future** and after a previous conversation
                  we had he asked me to pop in and document the event.

                  This year has been a photographers dream weather wise! Long hot
                  summers and a crisp colourful autumn! I can only hope for the winter
                  wonderland of my dreams
                  (and an awesome couple to play around in the snow).

                  Autumn brought me one of my favourite photoshoots of the year, an
                  engagement session with a couple I met in early October. Kasia & Caesar
                  were an amazingly fun couple to work with, quickly getting into their
                  own stride and showing me their personalities.

                <p>
                  We decided to shoot at St. Fagans national history museum on what must
                  of somehow been their busiest day of year!? A little deterred by
                  the amount of people, I decided it would be best to seek quieter ground
                  and we absconded to the castle. The first 20 minutes of any shoot
                  can be the most important, and I pride myself on making people feel
                  as comfortable and relaxed in front of the camera as possible.

                <p>
                  Once we found a couple of quiet spots by the water and the guys
                  loosened up, we decided to be a little more adventurous and autumnal!
                  Whats a good autumn shoot without playing around with some leaves!
                  Spontaneous shots are some of my favourites.Not without their
                  complications but you really get to see the joy and personality
                  in the people and the place.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After this, we were on a roll! The sun was shining, the leaves were
                  crisp, spirits were high! And no amount of crowds or photo bombers
                  could stop us!

                  Early September brought a beautiful, fun and quite frankly super
                  surprise wedding at the stunning venue of The Globe is Hay on Wye.

                  After a hazy week away visiting my parents for my birthday during the
                  drive home I had a phone call from a previous client of mine needing an
                  emergency photographer for a wedding for the very next day! A grand
                  total of 15 hours passed and I was at the venue photographing one of
                  the cutest countryside weddings ever!

                  The bride, Tahnee is another friend of mine. An absolutely beautiful
                  soul who picked a dress to match by e&w couture, one of my favourite
                  local designers. Whilst her sparkly new husband Paul, who is a
                  celebrity in the Haiku writing world made the whole room weep during
                  his speech.

                  The whole day was so filled with love with a smiley, happy ceremony,
                  a gorgeous venue and dreamy weather. Having never been to Hay On wye
                  before I was eager to explore the village with my couple. We wandered
                  around the cute higgledy piggledy streets and as both the bride and
                  groom are massive literary lovers we picked one of their favourite
                  book shops for a couple of portraits.

                  wedding was beautiful! So relaxed and colourful (a photographers dream really)
                  The weather was perfect and the guests were up for anything. More weddings

                <p style="padding: 1em;">Hello, howdy and hi!</p>
                <p style="padding: 1em;">
                  My name is Carmel Teresa McCabe and
                  I am quite frankly OBSESSED with weddings and everything about them!

                  For several years now I have been working in various fields of photography,
                  both commercially and personally. Since the planning of my own wedding my
                  love of love knows no bounds! I truly feel so privileged and honored to
                  share in the joy of so many peoples wedding day. Combining my passion of
                  creating beautiful imagery celebrating love!

                  My own wedding journey started when I made the move from the land locked
                  village where I grew up down to South wales to study photography. During
                  this time I have met some of the most fantastic people, the Welsh really
                  do know how to offer a warm welcome! One of these people was my now husband,
                  Killian. And after a whirlwind start, 7 years later we are happily married!

                <p>
                  Our engagement was looooong! Close to 3 years in fact! And in those years I
                  fully submerged myself in the joys of wedding planning. It was during this
                  time that I realised that surely there is nothing better in life than celebrating
                  love?! You dare you to try and convince me otherwise! My wedding day was truly
                  the happiest and most perfect day of my life and my job allows me to share that
                  beautiful feeling with other people over and over again!
